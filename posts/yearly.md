bigger change here this upcoming year.

* TODO
* TODO
* TODO

## Side-Projects
Not as many projects as I would have liked, but my focus this year has been
mostly on outdoor things. I did manage to release several Chef cookbooks that
our company uses under the MIT license.

### Succeeded

* [redis](https://github.com/copious-cookbooks/redis)

* [nginx](https://github.com/copious-cookbooks/nginx)
* [ntp](https://github.com/copious-cookbooks/ntp)
* [iptables](https://github.com/copious-cookbooks/iptables)
### Limbo
### Failed

## Regrets

* Didnt save enough money
* Not enough time off from work
* Didn't take enough film photographs
* Didn't develop my own photos
* Engine in Outback blew up and cost a lot
* Not traveling outside US
* Not learning a new language (again)
 
## Goals from 2015
Didn't get many goals done, I think the tech and photo really took a back seat
to climbing and fishing. Granted, the climbing was also impacted from a finger
injury that I was slow to return from. Father travel will require more planning.
