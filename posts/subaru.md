# [Subaru Outback](/subaru)

Information that I have collected for my 2005 Subaru Outback XT Limited.

*Update:* Engine has blown. Currently at Horizontal Motor Sports.

## Engine

[DOHC - Double Over Head Cam](http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/8137)

[EJ255 Version 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_EJ_engine#EJ255): Used in the 2005 and 2006 Legacy, as well as the 2004 and 2005
Forester. This engine uses the AB440 shortblock, which is the same shortblock as
the 2004-2006 STI EJ257. The heads on these EJ255 are the AB650s, while the US
04-06 STI is the familiar AB640/910. The cams are the same between the EJ255
Version 1 and the EJ257.

## Maintenance

A list of things to check and/or change out.

* Banjo bolt
* Oil and filter
* Fluid change
    * Transmission
    * Rear differential
    * Steering
* Air filter
* Spark plugs
* Coil packs
* Seafoam (Top-end cleaning?)
* Bushings
* Inner/Outer tie rods and ball joints 

### Banjo bolt
### Oil and filter

Popular recommendation seems to be Full Synthetic with turbo cars.

* K&N HP-1008 Filter
* Rotella T6

### Fluid Change

**Transmission and Rear differential**

Both use synthetic 75W-90 gear oil. Make sure its GL-5 rated.

You'll need 4QTs of fluid for the front and 1QT for the rear.

You will need a T70 Torx bit to take off the front drain plug. Remove dipstick,
remove and clean plug, drain fluid, re-install plug, use funnel and fill, then
re-install dipstick. Check levels afterwards.

The rear plugs are 1/2". A pump will be useful for flushing the rear fluids.
Remove both plugs, drain, then pump/fill until fluid runs clean out of bottom
hole, insert bottom plug, pump until fluid comes out of top hole, then plug top hole. 

If you have a torque wrench:

* Oil Drain Plug: 33 ft-lb
* Transmission Drain Plug (T70): 50.6 ft-lb
* Rear Drain and Filler Plugs: 36.2 ft-lb

## Modifications

* Uppipe
* Skid plate
* Lift
* Sway bar
* Turbo
* AccessPort
* Wheels
* Tires

### Uppipe
The stock uppipe comes with a catalytic converter that is known to disintegrate
and send pieces into your turbo, which then feeds into your engine.

It should be replaced with an uppipe that does not have a catalytic converter
and it does not require a 'bung' for the EGT sensor.

The EGT sensor is only there to monitor whether the cat is working properly. You
can disconnect the sensor and use a resistor to trick the ECU to not throw a code.
