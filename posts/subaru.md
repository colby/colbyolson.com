### Uppipe
The stock uppipe is known to disintegrate and send pieces into your turbo, which
then feeds into your engine.

It should be replaced with an uppipe that does not have a catalytic converter
and it does not require a 'bung' for the EGT sensor.

The EGT sensor is only there to monitor whether the cat is working properly. You
can disconnect the sensor and use a resistor to trick the ECU to not throw a code.
