* 1 tbsp. Cumin
* ½ tbsp. Paprika
* 2 tsp. Salt, or to taste
* ¾ tsp. Cinnamon
* ¾ tsp. Fresh ground Black pepper
* 2 tbsp. Garam masala

## Instructions
Place everything up to the bay leaves in a large bowl. With a spatula, stir to
combine everything and make sure the chicken is coated well.

Gently place the mixture in the insert of the crockpot and add the two bay leaves.

Cover and cook for 8 hours on low (or 4 hours on high).

When done, in a medium bowl, whisk together heavy cream and corn starch, then pour
the mixture into the crockpot and gently stir. Let cook an additional 20 minutes
to thicken up. Squeeze half a lemon over the mixture then stir to incorporate.

Serve hot over a bed of white (or brown) rice.

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
